\begin_layout NoteItem
Government agencies with a large infrastructure and workforce have the luxury
 of employing people full time to QC data before it's release.
 In this project we have no such luxury (plus, I am a computer scientist
 and am pre-disposed against performing mundane tasks).
 Therefore, we must automate the QC process, thereby essentially creating
 a form of artificial intelligence.

\begin_layout NoteItem
We chose to design our system as an expert system, so I'll describe that
 in the next couple of slide, but here's a brief description of some other
 options that could potentially be explored.
 Bayesian classification is a type of AI which uses statistics and logical
 rules attempt to classify data into different states.
 A good example of this is classification of spam e-mail.
 It actually a method that works very well, however it requires thousands
 of known data points from which to train itself on the probabilities.
 Connectionis architectures or neural networks can be a good choice, because
 they're better with handling noisy data.
 However, they also require training to be effect, are very sensitive to
 network topology and provide essentially zero traceability for how a decision
 was made.

\end_layout

\begin_layout NoteItem
An expert system is essentially a system that is constructed by the help
 of consultation with domain experts.
 These experts can provide specifics regarding the reasoning that they use
 when they are making a decisions, classifying data, or whatever the experts
 do.
 Their reasoning is then codified into a set of rules which can be applied
 to a data set.
 Because of it's simple design, the system has the ability to report on
 precisely why it made the decision that it did.
 However, this simplicity is also limiting, in that it can only make decisions
 based logic which can be articulated by experts and programmed by the computer
 scientists.

\end_deeper
\begin_layout NoteItem
To reiterate: we chose to design this as an expert system since this group
 has plenty of expertise in climate science and in reading meterological
 observations.
 This expertise, we felt, would be sufficiently accessible to design the
 expert system.
 Additionally, with using a rule-based approach and a modular design it
 is easy to allow the system to evolve as necessary as this project develops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout NoteItem
We also considered the applications which the products derived from this
 data will be supporting.
 These products will generally climate products, so it will not be necessary
 to eliminate every single incorrect record from the data set.
 As long as the dataset has some statistical integrity, it will be sufficient
 for use in producing climatological products.

\begin_layout NoteItem
Shown is a diagram of the system as it is designed and implemented.
 The primary components of importance are the import modules for each dataset
 shown at the top and the main quality control loop, shown in the middle.
 The import modules convert each blob of data into a set of per-station
 data frame with standardized variable names, attributes, etc.
 In the QC loop the user can apply various QC rules to the data frames and
 then examine the results.
 Or the user can write a simple script to mass-apply all of the data routines
 to all of the data sets.
 We have added a number of accessory plotting routines and statistical summary
 functions that can be applied to the standard data frames.
 On the right of the diagram it is shown that following satisfactory QC,
 the data can be archived and queried over the Internet by whomever the
 users of the data may be.

All of the raw data which we have received is stored on one of our PCIC
 development servers.
 It's a multi-user, multi-processor Linux system with enough RAM to handle
 the large amounts of data.
 Most of the time spent processing is data I/O.
 After data is loaded, it's fairly trivial, computationally, to pump it
 through a set of QC routines.

So once the import modules bring all of the data into a common format, it
 becomes easy to write generalized expert rules and apply them to each of
 the data frames.
 Generally we plot the results and you'll see some of those plots later
 in the slides.
 Now I'll go through the set of expert rules which we have implemented thus
 far.

\end_layout

\begin_layout NoteItem
This is one of the most simple rules.
 A few of the older dataset use grossly out-of-range values to represent
 the absence of data.
 We have a run that just takes a list of representative NA values as a parameter
 and does a mass find and replace.

Threshold filtering is the next easy way to get rid of a variety of fliers
 and false outliers.
 It's fairly simple for bounded variables such as wind direction and other
 variables which may not be negative.
 Threshold filtering on temperature is a bit more risky, but setting a generous
 threshold will at least get rid of some of the more egregious errors.

I inherited this rule from one of our programmers who did a lot of QC on
 (I think) some BC Hydro stations data and some snow-pillow data which were
 all daily observations.
 So currently the rule only checks t max - t min, and I haven't received
 any hits on it whatsoever.
 I think on my TODO list is to implement it as a moving window with a window
 width of 24 hours.
 That way it will probably actually be a useful rule.

This was a suggestion by Ted a couple of weeks ago, so we went ahead and
 implemented it.
 Given that there are times when the sensor goes bad or something, the observed
 quantities will essentially redline, with no changes.
 It seems easy to detect, but when we implemented it, we ran into a wide
 array of exceptions and qualifications.
 I'll show you a few of them later in the slides.

 It's advantageous in that it works over HTTP, there is lots of library

 So this was a run of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 using -99, and you can see that it removed the points down at the bottom

\begin_layout NoteItem
Threshold-based filtering is a little bit more tricky, however here is a
 case where it worked cleanly and completely.
 It's pretty unlikely the the temperature dropped below -40, so our threshold
 rule caught it and removed the points.

\begin_layout NoteItem
Now is where our rules become a little less clean-cut.
 Here is an example of the persistence filtering using a threshold of 5
 consecutive observations of temperature.
 You can see that at some point the sensor redlines at zero which is correctly
 identified and removed by the rule.
 However, you can also see that there are a series of bogus looking records
 between -30 and -50 that are probably sensor malfunctions which are not
 caught by the rule.
 Some of them may get caught by the threshold rule, but not all.

That said, it may not matter entirely if we don't get every single last
 bad data point.
 Given that these will eventually be used for developing the historic climatolog
y of the region, as long as the high level statistics are preserved, we're
 at least in better shape than if we had no data at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout NoteItem
So this frame show a boxplot of the temperature during the redline period
 before vs.
 after the persistence filtering.
 You can see that even with the few remaining outliers, the median is up
 around 8 degrees and the inter-quartile range doesn't extend down below
 zero.
 I.e.
 even filtering _some_ of the persistent observations buys us a lot in the
 statistical validity of the post-QC data.

\begin_layout NoteItem
On a number of stations such as this one, the persistence checking rule
 had a very high number of false positives.
 It's a little hard to see on this slide, but the reason for this was that
 the temperature sensor's precision (or at least the record) is only 1 degree.
 After December of 2002, the record contains sub-degree precision so the
 persistence checking is not tripped unduly.

\begin_layout NoteItem
Here is an example where our threshold filtering caught some observations
 which were out of range.
 However, looking at the graph you'll note that the structure of the data
 looks similar to the in-range data.
 I'm fairly certain that this was a case where the quantities were recorded
 in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius, however there is no metadata indicating
 as such.

\begin_layout NoteItem
To confirm the suspicions, I took the spurious data, assumed that it was
 in Fahrenheit, converted it to Celsius and plotted it in blue.
 What do you think? It seems to fit, however the daily ranges aren't quite
 as large as the rest of the data.
 I'd have to look into it more.

More cross-organization standardization will help to eliminate many of these
